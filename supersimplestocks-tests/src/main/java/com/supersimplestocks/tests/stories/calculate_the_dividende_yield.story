feature: calculate a stock dividende yield
In order to estimate the performance of a stock
As a trader
I want to know the stock dividende yield

Given the stocks have no trade
Given the stock POP has had a trade of 10 shares at 120 USD in the past 15 mn
Given the stock POP has had a trade of 5 shares at 118 USD in the past 15 mn
Given the stock POP has had a trade of 2 shares at 125 USD in the past 15 mn
When I type in the POP symbol
Then the stock dividende yield should be 0.064
