feature: calculate a stock price earning ratio
In order to estimate the performance of a stock
As an investor
I want to know the stock price earning ratio

Given the stocks have no trade
Given the stock POP has had a trade of 10 shares at 120 USD in the past 15 mn
Given the stock POP has had a trade of 5 shares at 118 USD in the past 15 mn
Given the stock POP has had a trade of 2 shares at 125 USD in the past 15 mn
When I choose the price earning ratio option for the stock POP
Then the stock price earning ratio should be 15.625
